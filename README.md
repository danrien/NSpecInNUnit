# NSpecInNUnit

A repo to demonstrate running NSpec examples in a NUnit test suite.

One purpose is to help demonstrate this issue: https://github.com/mattflo/NSpec/issues/114

## Limitations

* Only works with NUnit 2
* All examples are run together. Running a single test (e.g. via ReSharper) only affects
  the test reporting.
